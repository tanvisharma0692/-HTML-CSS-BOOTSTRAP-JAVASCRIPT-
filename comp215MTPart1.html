                <h2>School of Information and Communications Technology</h2>
                <h3>Learn by doing.</h3>
                <p>Saskatchewan Polytechnic lets you apply what you’ve learned in the classroom to the work world.
                    Business Information Systems students have a six-month paid co-operative education work term between
                    Semesters 2 and 3. And in the three-year Computer Engineering Technology diploma program, students
                    put their skills to the test over three four-month paid co-op work terms.</p>
                <h2>On board with industry.</h2>
                <p>Several Information and Communications Technology programs are accredited nationally by key industry
                    associations, boosting your employability throughout Canada. In fact, Saskatchewan Polytechnic is
                    home to the Cisco Regional Academy for Saskatchewan, a real plus if you’re enrolling in our Computer
                    Networking Technician program. If you’re heading into our Graphic Communications program, you can
                    apply for a Canadian Printing Industries Association scholarship.</p>
                <h2>Ladder to a degree.</h2>
                <p>Saskatchewan Polytechnic has transfer agreements with several Canadian universities. Complete your
                    diploma in Business Information Systems, Computer Engineering Technology, or Library and Information
                    Technology, and apply to transfer into a degree program.</p>
